                <p>
                    The Association resolved to give scholarship to indigent Students of Esan extraction at all levels of
                    education in its

                    Under this project, AEP seeks to collaborate with well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies to
                    provide scholarship
                    to indigent Students of Esan extraction at all levels of education. <br><br>
    
                    The project is a merit based yearly scholarship for indigent Esan pupils/students who have no hope of
                    financing their
                    education. It is aimed at providing education to brilliant Esan sons and daughters who would have
                    dropped out of school
                    for lack of funds. <br><br>
    
                    An evaluation system will be put in place for credible and transparent assessment of indigent Esan
                    children in public
                    primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. <br><br>
    
                    On the other hand, the project will also involve collaboration with the National Institute of
                    Construction Technology
                    (NICT), Uromi to provide vocational training for another set of Esan youths towards empowering Esan
                    people. <br><br>
    
                    We kindly solicit the support of all well meaning Esan sons and daughters world-wide, by donating
                    generously to our
