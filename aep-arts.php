                            The Association of Esan Professionals, the pre-eminent socio-economic group in Edo State in Nigeria’s South-South
                            geo-political zone has decided to explore Esan Cultural Values and Practices as a way of developing powerful and
                            creative ideas for economic development and economic empowerment in Esanland. <br>
                            Culture is the totality of the experience and technology of a people. It is the ways we think, act and the material
                            objects that together form our way of life. Culture is our past, our present and the guide to our future. <br>
                            The Esan people are well reputed as hardworking, innovative, peace-loving, God-fearing and fun-loving people. The roots
                            of these behaviors and attributes were laid in Esan traditions and rich cultural heritage <br>
                            In 2013, the AEP conducted a cultural excursion to all kingdoms in Esanland. Marriage & Bride Price, Taboos, Naming and
                            Burial Ceremonies, Divorce were the cultural variables studied. <br>
                            In 2015, AEP under the leadership of Rt. Hon Barrister Matthew Egbadon commissioned the second phase of investigation
                            into Esan culture. <br>
                            The 2015 research team investigated the traditional Kingship Institution, Dance, Festivals, Cultural Places and Heritage
                            Centres, Language, Age Grades, Fashion, Architecture, Chieftaincy investiture, Women Groups, traditional healthcare,
                            commerce, etc.

                        Esan kings ensure societal order and good governance. Historically, the children of the Oba of Benin at the time were
                        sent to rule the present-day Esanland, Obuluku and Ughelli.
                        Kingship in Esanland is usually the hereditary system, except the rotational kingship in Idoa and Ukhun which is
                        attributed to the Fulani war coupled with the rift that was caused by the premature death of the then Onojie. <br>
                        The duty of the Onojie is to administer over his people with the support of his council of Chiefs and Elders of the

                        A female cannot be crowned Onojie in Esanland, because out of the numerous King’s wives there must be a male child to
                        bear the crown. However, in a case where the Onojie has no male heir before his transition, the late Onojie’s younger
                        brother will take the stool.

                    In Esanland, there are cultural places with great significance to the community. These cultural places are meant only

                    “Okoughele” or the traditional parliament
                    Okoughele is an organized place by the community where elders and all other age grades of the town meet to talk about
                    progress and development of the community. Okoughele is known as Oguedion in Ujogba
                    There are various levels of age groups from Egbonughele to Enedion who make use of the Okoughele. The Enedion sit inside
                    Okoughele while Ighene and Egbonughele sits outside accordingly. The Ewaemhin (Parliamentary messengers) relate the
                    decisions of the Enedion to other groups outside.
                    Other cultural places in Esanland include Onojie’s Palace, Museum and shrines. There are various shrines in Esanland
                    with devotees evenly distributed among gender. These shrines reflect the traditional religious beliefs of the people.
                    Shrine is a conflict resolution centre where through traditional divination, disputes are settled.
                    Though there is no building called museum in his kingdom, the cultural artefacts are well preserved

                            commerce. Festive periods provide the opportunity to unwind, visit family and friends and engage in merriment. Esan
                            festivals include Ihuen or Ihulan, Ukpe, Utun, Idumuamukpe, Ukpeze, Iruen among others. Festivals usually mark a season,
                            celebrate great personalities or moments in history.
                            The Ukpeze festival is tied to the origin of Ewohimi people. Many years ago, the Oba of Benin sent the Ezomon to install
                            the Onojie of Ewohimi. Unfortunately, the Ezomon died in Ewohimi in the line of duty. In his remembrance, the Ewohimi
                            people instituted Ukpeze.
                            Iduamukpe festival is a unique festival celebrated with native beans called Ikpakpa and that it is set aside to pay
                            homage to the first son by his younger siblings.
                            Ihuan festival in Ekpoma brings together every son and daughter of Ekpoma, the world over, every February or March.

                        Without a doubt, the Igbabonelimin dance is the greatest international cultural export of Esanland and has
                        today assumed
                        a major identity of the Esan people. However, there are other prominent dances in Esanland which add colour
                        and pomp to
                        various festivities
                        The structure of the Igbabonelimin dance group is made of dancers, drummers and singers. The name
                        Igbabonelinhim is
                        derived from the mystical nature of the masquerade.
                        The Ijeleghe dance is of Ikeke-ihiala Usugbeun, Irrua.
                        The Olekhe dance, also known as Egwu-Uku or Ikhilen-Akun by Ekpon people, is the famous waist dance in Esan
                        land. Olekhe
                        dance has been described as a blend of Esan Asongun and Ika dance.
                        The origin of Asonogun dance was attributed to a certain man called Ogun who had long delay in child bearing
                        and when he
                        eventually gave birth, the community erupted in a huge jubilation, joy, happiness and the dance was
                        choreographed to
                        express their job for Ogun’s good fortune.
                        Ikhinabojie is another popular dance in Esanland particularly in Iruekpen Ekpoma. The dance is performed by
                        energetic
                        young men and women.

                        <h3>LANGUAGE</h3> 
                        Nothing defines a people more than their language. A language is defined as a system of sounds, written symbols and/or
                        signs used by the people of a particular area or tribe or status to communicate with one another. Language denotes a
                        people’s ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication. Esan language has evolved over the years from the
                        core in Irrua and radiating outwards to distant communities where many dialects exist. In distal communities such as
                        Igueben and Ekpon the Esan language has retained many of the syllables inherited from the Benin Kingdom. Ekpon, the
                        border town of Esan land to the East, often referred to as Delta Igbo, speaks a dialect that blends Esan language and
                        Ika language of Agbor.
                        
                        Igueben language is a very unique one in the sense that it is a combination of Esan language and Bini language
                        
                        <h3 class="pt-5">GREETINGS</h3> 
                        Greetings and courtesy are among the key verbal pillars of culture. In Esan land, there are greetings for various
                        persons depending on relationship (parent), status, (King and Chief), age, (senior junior, mate) gender, time of day and
                        special occasion and in some cases, the reason for gathering.
                        the popular Esan greeting is “Aesan”.

                        Healthcare is as old as man. Before the advent of modern medicine, Esan people relied on herbs, bark, and animal parts
                        for treatment of diseases. Beyond this general medicare, Esanland is famous for bone setting.
                        Their medical procedure does not include amputation and use of injections, yet achieve great result and healing,
                        comparable to orthodox method.
                        Patients are brought to Ogwa for bone setting from all over Nigeria because of the successes recorded.
                        Ugbesin is an herbal medicine use for the treatment of accident victims. It dissolves blood clot in the body. Ugbesin is
                        of two types; liquid and powder.

                taken a variant of the Edo language, but created an ingenious fashion style to underscore their identity. Ewohimi is

                The Izakpa is a complementary fashion worn on Igbulu or Agbada by Esan eminent persons. Izakpa is made of animal skin.
                It is note-worthy that the Izakpa is not mere cosmetic but has spiritual significance.

            <h3><center>ESAN TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE</center></h3>
            <p>
                Marriage also known as matrimony is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal marriage contract between two
                individuals that establish obligations and rights between them and their children and in-laws. <br>
                The concept of marriage is not a new practice and it has been a part of our society since ancient times. <br>
                Traditional marriage is usually an arrangement between two families as opposed to an arrangement between two
                individuals. <p></p>
            </p>

                    <p>
                        Accordingly, there is mutual requirement from the bride and bridegroom to make the marriage work as any problem will
                        usually affect both families and strain the otherwise cordial relationship between them.
                    <p></p>
                    
                    The man usually pays the bride-price as he is considered the head of the family. <br>
                    The payment of bride price is vital to the conclusion of marriage notable under Esan native law, which like any other
                    customary law marriage in Nigeria; it is recognized under the Marriage Act. The bride price is usually very low, the
                    impression being that Esan people do not sell their daughters in marriage.
                    The bride price is normally about ₦24 (representing 24 cowries or British pounds used in the pre-colonial and colonial
                    days). A huge sum is usually presented these days, from which the father of the bride or a prominent member of the
                    bride’s family would remove a small amount and refund the balance to the groom for his wife, their daughter`s up
                    keeping. <p></p>
                    Hence the tradition that at death, the corpse of Esan married woman is returned to her family to be buried with her
                    ancestors. <p></p>
                    Prior 1897, girls were generally regarded as ready for marriage between the ages of 15 through 18. Courtship can begin
                    among the individuals during the trip to the river to fetch water or during the moonlight play – EVIONTOI. <p></p>
                    
                    Sometimes parents actually go looking for a wife or husband for their children. This led to the BETROTHAL SYSTEM where
                    marriage was conducted with or without the consent of the individuals involved. <br>
                    Sometimes such betrothal, took place
                    when a baby girl was born. Suitors would begin to approach the parents by sending a log of wood or bundle of yam to the
                    parents of the child. <br>
                    You are likely to hear statements such as -” Imu’ Ikerhan gboto”-I have dropped a log of firewood. <br>
                    When a boy decides to get married and the parents have accepted the bride as a prospective daughter-in-law, messages go
                    up and down between the two families. This is called IVBUOMO-SEEKING FOR A BRIDE. <p></p>
                    Series of investigations are conducted by both families – about disease, scandals and crimes which may affect the
                    families. <br>
                    The term of the marriage which of course may include the pride-price would be settled in some families. Gifts
                    for mother of the bride and IROGHAE- members of the extended family would be part of the settlement. Then a date would
                    be fixed for the ceremony which would take place in the home of the would-be bride’s family. <p></p>
                    
                    There would of course be a lot of merriment on the day of marriage when the bride and the bridegroom are presented
                    openly to the two families. <p></p>
                    
                    Kola nuts and wine are presented. The OKA EGBE of the woman’s family would normally preside over the ceremony. <br>
                    Prayers are said and kola nuts broken at the family shrine. Rituals vary from family to family. <br>
                    The woman always sits on her father’s lap before she is given away. <br>
                    Amidst prayers, laughter and sometimes tears, the woman would be carefully
                    hoisted on the lap of the OKA EGBE of the bride’s family. <p></p>
                    
                    Many years ago, the woman would be sent to the bridegroom house about thirteen days after IWANIEN OMO and gingerly
                    hoisted either on her husband’s lap or the OKAEGBE of his family. <br>
                    They are done immediately nowadays in the home of the
                    bridegroom. <br>
                    The bride, now known as OVBIOHA would be led by her relatives to the husband’s house with all her property
                    meanwhile the family and friends of the bridegroom are feasting, drinking, singing and dancing while waiting for the
                    bride to arrive. <p></p>
                    
                    The list of items required for Esan traditional marriage vary from one clan to another and one community to another in
                    Esanland. <br>
                    Therefore, it is imperative to contact the would-be in-laws for the marriage list. <br>
                    The section Esan Traditional Marriage was Culled from “Esan Traditional Marriage and Taboos” by Prince Kelly O. Udebhulu

                    The bride price is normally about ₦24 (representing 24 cowries or British pounds used in the
                    pre-colonial and colonial
                    days). A huge sum is usually presented these days, from which the father of the bride or a prominent
                    member of the
                    bride’s family would remove a small amount and refund the balance to the groom for his wife, their
                    daughter`s up
                    keeping. <p></p>
                    Hence the tradition that at death, the corpse of Esan married woman is returned to her family to be
                    buried with her
                    ancestors. <p></p>
                    Prior 1897, girls were generally regarded as ready for marriage between the ages of 15 through 18.
                    Courtship can begin
                    among the individuals during the trip to the river to fetch water or during the moonlight play –
                    EVIONTOI. <p></p>
    
                    Sometimes parents actually go looking for a wife or husband for their children. This led to the
                    BETROTHAL SYSTEM where
                    marriage was conducted with or without the consent of the individuals involved. <br>
                    Sometimes such betrothal, took place
                    when a baby girl was born. Suitors would begin to approach the parents by sending a log of wood or
                    bundle of yam to the
                    parents of the child. <br>
                    You are likely to hear statements such as -” Imu’ Ikerhan gboto”-I have dropped a log of firewood. <br>
                    When a boy decides to get married and the parents have accepted the bride as a prospective
                    daughter-in-law, messages go
                    up and down between the two families. This is called IVBUOMO-SEEKING FOR A BRIDE. <p></p>
                    Series of investigations are conducted by both families – about disease, scandals and crimes which may
                    affect the
                    families. <br>
                    The term of the marriage which of course may include the pride-price would be settled in some families.
                    Gifts
                    for mother of the bride and IROGHAE- members of the extended family would be part of the settlement.
                    Then a date would
                    be fixed for the ceremony which would take place in the home of the would-be bride’s family. <p></p>
    
                    There would of course be a lot of merriment on the day of marriage when the bride and the bridegroom are
                    presented
                    openly to the two families. <p></p>
    
                    Kola nuts and wine are presented. The OKA EGBE of the woman’s family would normally preside over the
                    ceremony. <br>
                    Prayers are said and kola nuts broken at the family shrine. Rituals vary from family to family. <br>
                    The woman always sits on her father’s lap before she is given away. <br>
                    Amidst prayers, laughter and sometimes tears, the woman would be carefully
                    hoisted on the lap of the OKA EGBE of the bride’s family. <p></p>
    
                    Many years ago, the woman would be sent to the bridegroom house about thirteen days after IWANIEN OMO
                    and gingerly
                    hoisted either on her husband’s lap or the OKAEGBE of his family. <br>
                    They are done immediately nowadays in the home of the
                    bridegroom. <br>
                    The bride, now known as OVBIOHA would be led by her relatives to the husband’s house with all her
                    property
                    meanwhile the family and friends of the bridegroom are feasting, drinking, singing and dancing while
                    waiting for the
                    bride to arrive. <p></p>
    
                    The list of items required for Esan traditional marriage vary from one clan to another and one community
                    to another in
                    Esanland. <br>
                    Therefore, it is imperative to contact the would-be in-laws for the marriage list. <br>
